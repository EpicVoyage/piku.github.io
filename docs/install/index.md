# Installation

## Installation Methods

`piku` requires `Python 3`, [uWSGI][uwsgi], SSH, and a Linux distribution that runs `systemd`, such as Raspbian Jessie/Debian 8+/Ubuntu/Fedora/CentOS.

There are 3 ways to install `piku` on a server:

1. Use [piku-bootstrap](https://github.com/piku/piku-bootstrap) to do it if your server is already provisioned.

2. Use cloud-init to do it automatically at VPS build time (see the [cloud-init](https://github.com/piku/cloud-init) repository)

3. Manually: Follow the guide below or one of the platform-specfic guides. If you are running `piku` on specific Linux versions, feel free to contribute your own instructions.

## Generic Installation Steps

### Set up the `piku` user

`piku` requires a separate user account to run. To create a new user with the right group membership (we're using the built-in `www-data` group because it's generally thought of as a less-privileged group), enter the following command:

```bash
# pick a username
export PAAS_USERNAME=piku
# create it
sudo adduser --disabled-password --gecos 'PaaS access' --ingroup www-data $PAAS_USERNAME
# copy & setup piku.py
sudo su - $PAAS_USERNAME -c "wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piku/piku/master/piku.py && python3 ~/piku.py setup"
```

The `setup` output should be something like this:

```
Creating '/home/piku/.piku/apps'.
Creating '/home/piku/.piku/repos'.
Creating '/home/piku/.piku/envs'.
Creating '/home/piku/.piku/uwsgi'.
Creating '/home/piku/.piku/uwsgi-available'.
Creating '/home/piku/.piku/uwsgi-enabled'.
Creating '/home/piku/.piku/logs'.
Setting '/home/piku/piku.py' as executable.
```

### Set up SSH access

If you don't have an SSH public key (or never used one before), you need to create one. The following instructions assume you're running some form of UNIX on your own machine (Windows users should check the documentation for their SSH client, unless you have [Cygwin][cygwin] installed).

**On your own machine**, issue the `ssh-keygen` command and follow the prompts:

```bash
ssh-keygen 

Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/youruser/.ssh/id_rsa): 
Created directory '/home/youruser/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /home/youruser/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/youruser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
85:29:07:cb:de:ad:be:ef:42:65:00:c8:d2:6b:9e:ff youruser@yourlaptop.lan
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 2048]----+
<...>
+-----------------+
```

Copy the resulting `id_rsa.pub` (or equivalent, just make sure it's the _public_ file) to your `piku` server and do the following:

```bash
sudo su - piku
python3 piku.py setup:ssh /tmp/id_rsa.pub

Adding key '85:29:07:cb:de:ad:be:ef:42:65:00:c8:d2:6b:9e:ff'.
```

Now if you look at `.ssh/authorized_keys`, you should see something like this:

```bash
sudo su - piku
cat .ssh/authorized_keys
 
command="FINGERPRINT=85:29:07:cb:de:ad:be:ef:42:65:00:c8:d2:6b:9e:ff NAME=default /home/piku/piku.py $SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND",no-agent-forwarding,no-user-rc,no-X11-forwarding,no-port-forwarding ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQDhTYZi/qeJBKgU3naI8FNjQgeMYnMsEtqrOmUc4lJoPNH2qBUTNkzwThGqsBm2HNLPURWMiEifBqF+kRixMud67Co7Zs9ys7pwFXkJB9bbZasd2JCGfVZ4UYXHnvgejSWkLAV/4bObhsbP2vWOmbbm91Cwn+PGJgoiW08yrd45lsDmgv9cUAJS3e8LkgVELvIDg49yM5ArB88oxwMEoUgWU2OniHmH0o1zw5I8WXHRhHOjb8cGsdTYfXEizRKKRTM2Mu6dKRt1GNL0UbWi8iS3uJHGD3AcQ4ApdMl5X0gTixKHponStOrSMy19/ltuIy8Sjr7KKPxz07ikMYr7Vpcp youruser@yourlaptop.lan
```

This line is what enables you to SSH (and perform `git` over SSH operations) to the `piku` user without a password, verifying your identity via your public key, restricting what can be done remotely and passing on to `piku` itself the commands you'll be issuing.

### Test

From your machine, do:

```bash
ssh piku@pi.lan
